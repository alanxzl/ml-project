# ml-project
The purpose of the project is to build a machine learning software to recognize sketch drawings of objects.
The recognition is performed by a classifier that takes the input, given as a sequence of strokes of points in x and y, and recognizes the object category of the drawing.
In this project, we aim at designing a model to classify our data. We use training data to build our LSTM model and use train_and_evaluate estimator to figure out the accuracy.
